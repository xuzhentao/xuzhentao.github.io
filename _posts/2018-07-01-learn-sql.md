### Get Started
Recently I have started my Udemy course on MYSQL and HADOOP. Although I have self-learned some MYSQL and PHP two years ago, some systematic course on that will definitely be much helpful.

I was surprised that how powerful HADOOP, SPARK, and HIVE are when dealing with really large data, so I will learn them very quickly these days and apply them into the real industry and product development.

### Basic Table Operations

* Drop Database:  ``` DROP DATABASE <my_database_name>; ```
* Create Database: ```CREATE DATABASE <my_database_name>; ```
* Use Database: ```USE <my_database_name>;```
* Show the currently selected database: ```SELECT database();```
* Create table: ```CREATE TABLE mytesttable ( name type, name type, ..., name type);```
* Show All Tables: ```SHOW TABLES;```
* Show the columns of a table: ```SHOW COLUMNS FROM <tablename>;``` or ```DESC <tablename>;```
* Drop one table: ```DROP TABLE <tablename>;```
* Insert record into table: ```INSERT INTO <tablename> (<columnname>, ..., <columnname>) VALUES (value,...,value);```
* Insert Multi-record into table: ```INSERT INTO <tablename> (<columnname>, ..., <columnname>) VALUES (value,...,value),...,(value,...,value)```
* Show the warnings from before query: ```SHOW WARNING;```
* If not allow non-explicitly-setted-value, then when creating table, need NOT NULL after the type: ```CREATE TABLE cats2(<name> <type> NOT NULL, ...);```
