        <li><strong style="color:#333;">Batched Recommendation</strong>: Completed adaptive music recommendation systems that recommend trillions songs and millions users. Administered and optimized various recommendation algorithms behind Explore and Songbook pages.</li>

        <li><strong style="color:#333;">Real-time Recommendation</strong>: Improved web user engagement by 10% by building as a chief developer a brand-new real-time music recommendation system. Implemented modules including real-time feature extraction, ranking, database communication, and training modules. Used tools including Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Flink, Cassandra, Redis, Kafka etc.</li>

        <li><strong style="color:#333;">Features Extraction</strong>: Improved users’ average music listening time by 30%, 12%, and 5% separately by developing three new features for personalized recommendation models behind Feed, Explore, and Songbook pages. (co-authored in publication).</li>

        <li><strong style="color:#333;">NLP</strong>: Led researches on classification and keywords extraction, trained model on comments data with tools TensorFlow and NTLK.</li>
